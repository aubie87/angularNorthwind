# angularNorthwind
Angular frontend for the Northwind database and Visual Studio 2015 Express.

The project is primarily used as a reference as new technologies are learned and/or applied. In some cases, specific working examples will named per folders under AngularJS Single Page Apps (SPA). In other cases these examples will only be viewable within the code itself with sufficient comments (and occasional url references).

Ideally, this project will flow like a living and working tutorial for my own good pleasure. Often, many of the features that are highlighted were difficult to find on the Internet.

The Northwind database was selected because many "old school" Microsoft devlepers will be readily familiar with its structure. The backend data is not relevant other than to provide near real world complexity in a reasonably sized database.

## And So We Begin
Creating and initializing the project.
